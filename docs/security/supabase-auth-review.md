# Supabase Auth & RLS Security Review

## Scope
- Verify implementation of Supabase authentication using `@supabase/ssr` within the Next.js app.
- Confirm that row-level security (RLS) policies are enabled and enforced on the relevant database tables.

## Findings
1. **Supabase client integration is absent.**
   - A repository-wide search for Supabase packages or usage yielded no results, indicating that `@supabase/ssr`, `@supabase/supabase-js`, or related helpers are not present in the codebase.【6d3c99†L1-L2】
2. **No authentication middleware or helpers detected.**
   - There are no Next.js middleware, server components, or API routes instantiating a Supabase client or handling auth session cookies.【f0e6ee†L1-L2】
3. **Database/RLS configuration missing.**
   - The project contains specifications referencing Supabase and RLS in documentation, but there is no actual database package or SQL migration defining tables, enabling RLS, or creating policies.【F:docs/specs/FreshComply-Consolidated-Spec.md†L13-L34】

## Risk Assessment
- **Status:** Requirements not implemented.
- **Impact:** Without Supabase auth integration, the portal cannot enforce user authentication or authorization. Absence of RLS means multi-tenant data segregation is unenforced, posing a critical security risk if data were ingested.
- **Likelihood:** High, given the complete lack of implementation.

## Recommendations
1. **Implement Supabase auth using `@supabase/ssr`.**
   - Add a shared client factory that uses `createServerClient` / `createClient` from `@supabase/ssr` and ensure session management via cookies.
   - Protect server components, API routes, and middleware by retrieving the authenticated user and enforcing access checks.
2. **Define database schema with RLS policies.**
   - Use SQL migrations (e.g., via `supabase db`) to create core tables and enable RLS (`alter table ... enable row level security;`).
   - Write tenant-aware policies (e.g., matching `organisation_id`) and cover all tables that store customer data.
3. **Add automated checks.**
   - Integrate linting/tests that fail CI if Supabase env vars are missing or if migrations do not enable RLS on protected tables.

## Conclusion
Supabase authentication via `@supabase/ssr` and RLS policies are **not currently implemented**. Addressing the gaps above is required before launch to achieve the intended security posture.
