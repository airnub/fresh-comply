## Quick Start (10‑Step Overview)

**Print this checklist and tick as you go.**

- [ ] Decide **CLG (no share capital)** as the legal form (default for Irish non‑profits).  
- [ ] Draft a **charity‑ready CLG constitution** (objects/public benefit; income & property; asset lock; winding‑up).  
- [ ] Line up **2+ directors** and a **company secretary**. Ensure **at least one EEA‑resident director** (or arrange **Section 137 bond**).  
- [ ] Confirm each director has a **PPSN** or obtain a **Verified Identity Number (VIN)** via CRO **VIF** process.  
- [ ] **Incorporate on CRO CORE** (Form **A1** + constitution). Note your **CRO number** & **Annual Return Date (ARD)**.  
- [ ] Within **5 months** of incorporation: **file Beneficial Ownership** on the **RBO** portal.  
- [ ] Open a **non‑profit bank account** (constitution + CRO docs + IDs + board minute).  
- [ ] Register for taxes via **Revenue TR2** (CT mandatory; add PAYE if hiring; VAT only if needed).  
- [ ] Get **ROS** access (RAN → digital certificate → login). Apply for **eTax Clearance** (needed for many grants).  
- [ ] If eligible, **register as a Charity** (Charities Regulator) → then **apply to Revenue for CHY** (charity tax exemption). Enable **Charitable Donation Scheme** & review **Charities VAT Compensation** eligibility.  

---

## Choose Your Legal Form

**Recommended default:** **Company Limited by Guarantee (CLG)** with **no share capital**.  
**Why:** Limited liability, widely accepted by funders, robust governance, suitable for charities and social enterprises.  

**Minimum officers:**  
- **Directors:** At least **2**.  
- **Company Secretary:** Required. In multi‑director companies, a director may act as secretary, but many NGOs appoint a separate person for good governance.  
- **EEA‑resident director:** At least **one** director must be **resident in the EEA**. If not, obtain a **Section 137 bond** or seek a *real and continuous link* exemption.  

**Other forms (for context):**  
- **Unincorporated association:** Quick to start; weak liability protection.  
- **Charitable trust:** Useful in specific scenarios; often paired with a CLG operating entity.  
- **CLG with charity status:** Most common for charities; you **register with the Charities Regulator** after incorporation if your purposes are exclusively charitable and of public benefit.

---

## Name & Constitution (Your Rulebook)

1) **Pick a name** that’s not already taken and not restricted.  
   - Name check & reservation: **CRO “CORE”** → <https://core.cro.ie/>  
2) **Draft your constitution** (CLG). Use a **charity‑ready template** that includes:  
   - **Objects** (charitable purposes & public benefit)  
   - **Income & property clause** (no distributions to members)  
   - **Winding‑up / asset lock** (assets to another charity)  
   - **Powers** (to do things necessary to pursue objects)  
   - **Membership** (guarantee amount, e.g., €1)  
   - **Board/meetings** (quorum, terms, conflicts)  

**Tip:** If you plan to become a **registered charity**, write your constitution to **meet the Charities Regulator and Revenue expectations from day one**—this saves time later.

**Useful models:**  
- Charities‑aligned CLG constitutions are referenced by Irish public bodies and sector guides. If you need a fill‑in‑the‑blanks template, use the **[Sample clauses](#sample-constitution-clauses)** below, then have a solicitor or experienced advisor review.

---

## Incorporate with the CRO (Get Your CRO Number)

**Goal:** File **Form A1** + your **constitution** via **CRO CORE** to create your CLG and obtain your **CRO number**.  

**What you’ll need:**  
- Signed **Form A1** details (directors/secretary; registered office; PPSN/VIN for each director)  
- The **constitution** (PDF)  
- Payment method for fee  

**Director identity (PPSN/VIN):**  
- CRO requires **director PPSNs** to match Department of Social Protection records.  
- If a director has **no PPSN**, use the CRO **Verified Identity Form (VIF)** to obtain a **VIN**.  

**EEA‑resident director:**  
- Ensure at least **one** director is resident in an **EEA** state, **or** arrange a **Section 137 bond** (2‑year bond, prescribed wording).  

**After incorporation:**  
- You’ll receive your **CRO number**.  
- Note your **Annual Return Date (ARD)** in CORE (this drives your annual B1 filing deadline).  
- Prepare for **financial statements** requirements (see *Compliance Calendar*).  

**Links:**  
- CRO CORE: <https://core.cro.ie/>  
- CRO forms & guidance: <https://www.cro.ie/>  
- VIF (Verified Identity Form): search “CRO VIF form” on cro.ie  
- Section 137 bond: search “CRO Section 137 bond” on cro.ie

---

## Open a Bank Account

Most banks will request:  
- **Constitution** and **CRO incorporation documents**  
- **Proof of identity & address** for **signatories/controlling persons**  
- **Board minute** authorising the account & setting signing rules  

**Tip:** Ask for a “**community/non‑profit/current**” account type and clarify **fee waivers** and **dual authorisation** options.

Examples:  
- AIB Community Accounts: <https://aib.ie/business/business-accounts/community-accounts>  
- Check also BOI/Ulster/KBC or trusted fintechs that support Irish NGOs.

---

## Register for Tax & Get ROS Access

Even if you plan to apply for charity tax exemption later, **companies must register with Revenue**.

1) **TR2 (Resident companies) tax registration:**  
   - **Corporation Tax (CT)** — mandatory for companies  
   - **PAYE (Employer)** — if hiring staff  
   - **VAT** — only if you cross thresholds or engage in taxable activity  
   - Online info: <https://www.revenue.ie/> (search **TR2**)

2) **ROS (Revenue Online Service) access:**  
   - Get a **ROS Access Number (RAN)** & apply for a **ROS Digital Certificate**  
   - Install/download the cert, then sign into **ROS**  
   - ROS help: <https://www.revenue.ie/en/online-services/index.aspx>

3) **eTax Clearance:**  
   - Apply in ROS. Many State grants require **up‑to‑date tax clearance**.  

**Tip:** Set up **roles/permissions** in ROS so your treasurer/accountant has the right access.

---

## Register as a Charity (If Applicable)

In Ireland, organisations with **exclusively charitable purposes** and **public benefit** must **register with the Charities Regulator**.

**Steps:**  
1) Confirm your constitution and activities meet the **charitable purposes** tests.  
2) Prepare documents: constitution, director/trustee details, activities/beneficiaries, financial plan.  
3) Apply via **Charities Regulator** portal.  
4) Once approved, you’ll receive a **Registered Charity Number (RCN)**.

**Link:** <https://www.charitiesregulator.ie/>

**Note:** Charity registration is **separate** from **Revenue’s charitable tax exemption**. After you’re on the Register, apply to **Revenue** for **CHY** (below).

---

## Apply for Charitable Tax Exemption (CHY)

**Goal:** Obtain **CHY charitable tax exemption** from Revenue so you can access charity tax reliefs.

**Key reliefs to consider:**  
- **Charitable Donation Scheme:** For **individual donations ≥ €250 in a tax year**, the charity can claim a **tax refund** (using CHY3/CHY4; the specified rate is currently **31%**).  
- **Charities VAT Compensation Scheme:** Claim back a **proportion of VAT** on eligible costs funded by **non‑public income**. Claims open in **ROS 1 Jan–30 Jun** for the **prior calendar year**; the scheme is capped annually at a national fund level (payouts are pro‑rata).

**Links:**  
- Charities & Sports Bodies (Revenue): <https://www.revenue.ie/en/companies-and-charities/charities-and-sports-bodies/charities/index.aspx>  
- Donations to charities (CHY3/CHY4): <https://www.revenue.ie/en/companies-and-charities/charities-and-sports-bodies/charities/donations-to-charities-and-approved-bodies.aspx>  
- VAT Compensation Scheme: <https://www.revenue.ie/en/companies-and-charities/charities-and-sports-bodies/charities/vat-compensation-scheme.aspx>

---

## Beneficial Ownership (RBO)

All Irish companies must maintain a **Register of Beneficial Owners** and **file details with the RBO**.  
- **Deadline for new companies:** File within **5 months** of incorporation.  
- **Keep it current:** Update filings when beneficial owners change.  

**Link:** <https://rbo.gov.ie/>

---

## Operating the Organisation: Governance, Policies & Controls

**Foundational governance** (Charities Governance Code‑aligned good practice):  
- **Board calendar & annual plan**  
- **Minutes** (agenda, decisions, actions)  
- **Conflicts of interest/loyalty register**  
- **Financial controls** (segregation of duties; dual approvals; delegated authority)  
- **Risk register** (review quarterly)  

**Core policy pack (starter set):**  
- Governance Code compliance statement  
- Financial controls policy (purchasing, expenses, petty cash, reserves)

- Health & Safety statement (if you have premises/staff)  

**Fundraising rules:**  
- Comply with Charities Regulator’s fundraising guidance.  
- **Street/house‑to‑house collections** require permits under statute (check local Garda/Authority procedures).  

**Data protection:**  
- See **Data Protection Commission** guidance: <https://www.dataprotection.ie/>  

**Safeguarding:**  
- **Children First** obligations & **Tusla** guidance: <https://www.tusla.ie/>

---

## Compliance Calendar (At‑a‑Glance)

**CRO (Companies Registration Office)**  
- **B1 Annual Return** by **ARD** (first return shortly after incorporation; financial statements required thereafter).  
- File director/secretary/address changes promptly (B10/B2).  

**RBO**  
- Initial filing within **5 months**; keep current.  

**Revenue**  
- **CT** returns as scheduled; **PAYE** real‑time submissions if employing.  
- Maintain **eTax Clearance** (often checked by funders).  

**Charities Regulator**  
- Maintain details; complete **annual report/return**; follow **Charities Governance Code**.  

**Fundraising**

## FAQ

**Do we need to register as a charity?**  
If your purposes are **exclusively charitable** and you provide a **public benefit**, you must register. If not (e.g., advocacy without charitable objects), you can operate as a CLG non‑profit without being a registered charity.

**Can directors be paid?**  
Directors of charities are generally **not remunerated for their role** (expenses may be reimbursed). Staff roles (separate from board office) can be paid.

**What about VAT?**  
Charities are **not automatically VAT‑exempt**. Use the **VAT Compensation Scheme** to reclaim a **portion** of VAT funded by **non‑public** income.

**Do we need an auditor?**  
Audit/examination thresholds depend on **company law** and **charities guidance**. Many smaller charities can avail of **audit exemption** if criteria are met, but funders may still require an audit.

**Can we fundraise immediately?**  
You can accept donations, but **public collections** (street/house‑to‑house) need permits. For tax‑efficient donations (CHY), you need **charity tax exemption** in place.

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them

- **Constitution not charity‑ready:** causes delays at Charities Regulator/Revenue — use model clauses now.  
- **No EEA‑resident director / no S137 bond:** CRO blocks incorporation — plan directors early.  
- **Missing PPSNs/VINs:** A1 filing fails — verify identity details first.  
- **Forgetting RBO:** must be filed within **5 months** — add to your setup calendar.  
- **Weak financial controls:** risks to funding and compliance — adopt control policy & segregate duties.  
- **Data protection gaps:** map data flows; publish privacy notice; train people.  
- **Late filings:** track **ARD**, ROS deadlines, charity annual return dates.  

---
