# Irish Non‑Profit Structures & Charity Registration — Quick Guide

**Version:** 2025‑10‑02  
**Use‑case focus:** Building public‑interest software, accepting public donations, and applying for Government grants in Ireland.

## 1) The Main Non‑Profit Legal Forms (Plain‑English)

### Company Limited by Guarantee (CLG, no share capital)
The Irish sector’s default non‑profit company. Separate legal entity, limited liability, board governance, widely accepted by funders, and the most common vehicle for charities and social enterprises.

### Unincorporated Association
Simple rules‑based club with **no** limited liability or separate legal personality—harder to hire, lease, or take on bigger grants. Often a temporary start phase before moving to a CLG.

### Charitable Trust
A trust deed with trustees holding assets; can work for grant‑making or holding funds, but less convenient for an operating/software org.

### Co‑operative / Industrial & Provident Society (IPS)
Member‑owned, mission‑led enterprise form (registered with the Registry of Friendly Societies). Useful if you want democratic member control. Some grantmakers still prefer a charity CLG.

> **Note:** “Charity” is a **regulatory status**, not a separate legal form. Most charities are CLGs (or trusts/associations) that register with the Charities Regulator.

## 2) Best Fit for “Build Software + Grants + Public Donations”

**Recommendation:** a **CLG (no share capital)**, drafted from day one with **charity‑ready objects** and standard **income & property / asset‑lock** clauses.

**Why this works**
- Recognised and expected by funders & public bodies
- Limited liability + clear board governance
- Clean pathway to **charity registration** and **Revenue charitable tax exemption (CHY)**
- Unlocks **Charitable Donation Scheme** (gross‑up on eligible individual donations ≥ €250)
- Compatible with public grants that require robust governance/tax clearance

**If you expect commercial income** (licensing, support services, paid integrations): keep the charity CLG “pure” and add a **trading subsidiary** (ordinary company) for non‑primary‑purpose trading. Profits can be donated to the charity.

## 3) Criteria to Register as a Charity (Charities Act 2009)

To appear on the **Register of Charities**, you must satisfy the **charity test**:

**(A) Charitable Purpose(s)** — one or more of:
1. Prevention or relief of **poverty or economic hardship**  
2. Advancement of **education**  
3. Advancement of **religion**  
4. **Other purposes beneficial to the community** (e.g., community welfare, health, integration of the disadvantaged, environmental protection, animal welfare, arts/culture, etc.)

**(B) Public Benefit** — your activities benefit the public (or a section of the public) in identifiable ways; any private benefit is incidental; and your constitution/activities are **exclusively** for your charitable purposes.

### Mapping software projects to charitable purposes
- **Advancement of education:** open educational platforms, digital literacy tools, Irish‑language learning tech
- **Benefit of the community:** public‑interest information services; accessibility tech; safety/health tools provided free or at nominal cost

> Your **objects** and real‑world use must make the public benefit clear.

## 4) Process (High Level)
1. **Incorporate** a CLG (CRO) with charity‑ready constitution  
2. **Register as a charity** (Charities Regulator) once your purposes/activities meet the tests  
3. Apply to **Revenue** for **charitable tax exemption (CHY)** via ROS  
4. Enable **Charitable Donation Scheme** procedures (CHY3/CHY4) and assess **Charities VAT Compensation** eligibility (annual Jan–Jun claim window for the prior year)

## 5) Decision Helper
- **I want donations, philanthropic grants, and State funding for public‑interest software.**  
  → **CLG** → **Charity registration** → **CHY** (maximises eligibility and donation tax efficiency)

- **I also plan some commercial contracts/licensing.**  
  → Keep the charitable CLG focused on mission; run non‑primary‑purpose trading via a **separate trading subsidiary**; gift‑aid/profit‑transfer to the charity

- **I want democratic member ownership above all.**  
  → Consider a **Co‑op/IPS**, noting some funders still prefer a charity CLG

---

## 6) Setup Footnotes You’ll Care About
- Any Irish company needs **at least one EEA‑resident director** or a **Section 137 bond** (plan this before filing)  
- To use the **Charitable Donation Scheme**, you must be an **eligible charity** with **CHY**; individual gifts ≥ €250 can be grossed‑up by the charity  
- Keep governance strong: board minutes, conflict register, financial controls, GDPR & safeguarding where relevant

## 8) Bottom Line
Form a **CLG (no share capital)** with charity‑compliant objects → **register with the Charities Regulator** → **apply for CHY**. This structure best supports a public‑interest software mission funded by donations and Government grants, while leaving room for a trading subsidiary if you later need one.
